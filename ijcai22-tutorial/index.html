            Functional synthesis is the problem of synthesizing outputs as functions of inputs, while satisfying a declarative relational specification between inputs and outputs.  The tutorial overviews recent approaches that combine advances in automated reasoning, knowledge compilation, and machine learning to solve a wide variety of practical functional synthesis problems. Given the fundamental importance of synthesis in computer science, recent developments in this area have been reported in several fora besides those pertaining to core AI.
        </p>
        <p>
            The tutorial is designed around three emerging research directions for synthesis:
        </p>
        <p>
        <ol class="justified">
            <li>
                <strong> Knowledge Compilation-Based Approaches: </strong>  Motivated by the success of knowledge compilation approaches in Bayesian inference; these approaches focus on compiling a specification into a representation language from which derivation of the desired programs/functions is tractable.

            </li>
            <br/>
            <li>
                <strong> Counterexample-Guided  Techniques: </strong> These approaches involve an intelligent initial "guess” of the desired system, followed by using an efficient solver to check if the guess satisfies the user’s requirements and incrementally repairs the system if it does not. This approach has been remarkably successful in different synthesis settings.
            </li>
            <br/>
            <li>
                <strong> Data-Driven Synthesis: </strong> These approaches focus on utilizing recent advances in constrained sampling to generate data (or examples), which is then fed to machine learning techniques to generate initial candidate functions. Subsequently, advances in unsatisfiable core calculation and analysis are used to repair the generated functions/programs, if necessary.
