    <h3 class="post-subtitle">December 3-6th, Indian Institute of Technology Delhi</h3>
  </header>
<article class="post-content clearfix">
        
    <h4 class="point">About</h4>
        <p> We are excited to invite you to the Winter School on Formal Verification and Program Synthesis, hosted at CSE IIT Delhi from December 3rd to 6th, 2024. This workshop is designed to provide participants with a comprehensive overview of recent advancements in constraint solvers and automated reasoning, along with their cutting-edge applications in diverse fields such as the verification of deep neural networks, security, blockchains and synthesis.
          The four-day workshop will feature a series of lectures and hands-on sessions led by <a href=https://subodhvsharma.github.io>Subodh Sharma</a>, <a href="https://kumarmadhukar.github.io">Kumar Madhukar</a>, and <a href = "https://priyanka-golia.github.io">Priyanka Golia </a>.
   <h4 class = "point"> List of Topics</h4> 
   <ul class="justified">
    <li><b>Subodh Sharma:</b> Introduction to Symbolic Execution and Bounded Model Checking; Applications to Security and Blockchains. Tools: CProver</li>
    <li><b>Kumar Madhukar:</b> Verification of Deep Neural Networks, Abstraction-Refinement, Invariants and Connection to Program Verification
        Hands-on session with a DNN verification tool (NeuralSAT/Marabou). </li>
    <li><b>Priyanka Golia:</b> Introduction to propositional logic modeling, constraint encoding, and the basics of SAT (Satisfiability) and SMT (Satisfiability Modulo Theories) solvers (basic introduction to DPLL and CDCL). Applications of these solvers in synthesis! Tools: Manthan, MiniSAT, Z3.
         </li>
      
   </ul>
   <h4 class="point">Application Process</h4>
      The typical profile of a participant will be a final-year undergraduate student or a post-graduate (Masters/PhD) student or an industry professional interested in getting introduced to advanced topics in formal verification and program synthesis.</br>
      <b> How to apply?</b> Please fill the form at <a href="https://forms.gle/T7gqKbVei8PQwf1x7">[this link]</a> before 11:59pm on 31st October 2024 to apply to attend the Winter school. The form requires you to read a paper, and write what you understood from it. Please budget at least two days for this.
