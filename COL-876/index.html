        <h4 class="point">What is this course about?</h4>
        <p>
            In this course, we will delve into the fascinating world of SAT solvers. SAT, or Boolean satisfiability, is a fundamental problem in computer science. At its core, the problem of Boolean satisfiability asks a simple question: given a Boolean formula, can we find an assignment of truth values to its variables that satisfies the formula? Boolean satisfiability is known to be NP-complete. However, modern SAT solvers offer efficient solutions capable of handling problems with tens of thousands of variables and millions of clauses in practical scenarios. </br>
            
           The beauty of SAT solvers lies in their efficiency. They employ sophisticated algorithms and techniques to efficiently explore the vast space of possible variable assignments, searching for a satisfying assignment. In this course, we will discover the secret behind modern SAT solvers, called conflict-driven clause learning (CDCL). It's like having a super-smart helper who learns from mistakes to solve problems faster!</br>

for most part of the course, we'll dive into how SAT solvers are used in real life in automated reasoning, from explainable or certified AI, to neuro-symbolic AI,   to verification and synthesis of automated systems, to optimization problems related to graphs. </p>

     </ol>

<h4 class="point">Prerequisites</h4>
<p> Recommended but not essential: Discrete Mathematical Structures and Logic for Computer Science.  </br>
It is required to have a basic knowledge of propositional logic, algorithms, and data structures, as well as familiarity with complexity theory (concepts like NP-completeness should not be unfamiliar), and proficiency in at least one programming language, such as Python.  <b> Please put a general reqeust to register the course on ERP</b></p>    
       
<h4 class="point"> Evaluation Policy (Tentative)</h4>
<ol class="justified">
  <li>
    Quizzes: 15% 
  </li><br/>
  <li>
    Minor: 20%
  </li><br/>
  <li>
    Class participation: 5% 
  </li>	<br/>
  <li>
    Projects: 60% ( 2 x 30%)
  </li> <br/>
  
</ol>

<ul class="justified">
  <li>
    Audit policy: To qualify for an NP grade, you need at least 60% score overall and at least 75% attendance.
  </li>
  <li>
    For a missed minor exam due to a medical reason, a make-up exam will be held after the regular major exam, covering the entire course syllabus. The weightage of this make-up exam will be 20%. Only students who obtain prior approval from the instructor (before the date of the missed regular minor exam) and have at least 75% attendance will qualify for this exam.
  </li><br/>
  <li> 
    A missed quiz will be awarded zero marks. No requests for a re-quiz will be considered.
  </li> <br/>
  <li>
    Project submissions after the deadline are allowed for the next 5 days. However, for each delayed day, a reduction of 5% will be applied. For example, projects submitted on the deadline will be evaluated for 30%. Projects submitted one day after the deadline will be evaluated for 25%, and so on. Projects submitted on the fifth day after the deadline will be evaluated for 5%. Projects submitted on the sixth day after the deadline will receive no evaluation.
