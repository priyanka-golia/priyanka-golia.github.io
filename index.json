Over the past decade, syntax-guided synthesis (SyGuS) has emerged as a dominant approach to program synthesis where in addition to the specification φ, the end-user also specifies a grammar L to aid the underlying synthesis engine. This paper investigates the feasibility of synthesis techniques without grammar, a sub-class defined as T-constrained synthesis. We show that T-constrained synthesis can be reduced DQF(T), i.e., to the problem of finding a witness of a dependency quantified formula modulo theory. When the underlying theory is bitvectors, the corresponding DQF problem can be further reduced to Dependency Quantified Boolean Formulas (DQBF). We rely on the progress in DQBF solving to design DQBF-based synthesizers that outpeform the domain-specific program synthesis techniques, thereby positioning DQBF as a core representation language for program synthesis. Our empirical analysis shows that T-constrained synthesis can achieve significantly better scalability than syntax-guided approaches. Furthermore, the general purpose DQBF solvers perform on par with domain-specific synthesis techniques. DeQuS takes a program synthesis instances and reduce it to a DQF(T) instance. Currenlty, DeQUS can only handle bitvector theory.\n","date":1646352000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1646352000,"objectID":"1fac878a95058204f0d5b88f4a6a309a","permalink":"/project/dequs/","publishdate":"2022-03-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/dequs/","section":"project","summary":"Program Synthesis as Dependency Quantified Formula Modulo Theory","tags":["program synthesis"],"title":"DeQuS","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Quantified information flow (QIF) has emerged as a rigorous approach to quantitatively measure confidentiality; the information-theoretic underpinning of QIF allows the end-users to link the computed quantities with the computational effort required on the part of the adversary to gain access to desired confidential information.

The state-of-the-art approach combines machine learning and automated reasoningto synthesise Boolean functions efficiently. In this paper, we propose fouralgorithmic improvements for a data-driven framework for functional synthesis: using a dependency-driven multi-classifier to learn candidatefunction, extracting uniquely defined functions by interpolation, variables retention, and using lexicographic MaxSAT to repair candidates. We implement these improvements in the state-of-the-art framework, called Manthan. The proposed framework is called Manthan2. Manthan2 shows significantly improved runtime performance compared to Manthan. In an extensive experimental evaluation on 609 benchmarks, Manthan2 is able to synthesise a Boolean function vector for 509 instances compared to 356 instances solved by Manthan – an increment of 153 instances over the state-of-the-art. To put this into perspective, Manthan improved on the prior state-of-the-art by only 76 instances.","tags":null,"title":"Engineering an Efficient Boolean Functional Synthesis Engine","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1625820300,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1625820300,"objectID":"6d8576abb9e2c88d2c5a8291f2db7a11","permalink":"/talk/09072021/","publishdate":"2021-07-09T14:15:00+05:30","relpermalink":"/talk/09072021/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"\u003cb\u003eOur paper Designing Samplers is Easy: The Boon of Testers has been accepted to \u003ca href=\"https://fmcad.org/FMCAD21/\"\u003eFMCAD 2021\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/b\u003e \u003cbr\u003e Our Sampler not only passes the tests of Barbarik but also leads to significant performance improvements for real-world instances. \u003cbr\u003e Joint work with: Mate Soos, Sourav Chakraborty, Kuldeep S.
