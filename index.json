Although the past few years have witnessed intense algorithmic development, accomplishing scalability remains the holy grail. The state-of-the-art approach combines machine learning and automated reasoningto synthesise Boolean functions efficiently. In this paper, we propose fouralgorithmic improvements for a data-driven framework for functional synthesis: using a dependency-driven multi-classifier to learn candidatefunction, extracting uniquely defined functions by interpolation, variables retention, and using lexicographic MaxSAT to repair candidates. We implement these improvements in the state-of-the-art framework, called Manthan. The proposed framework is called Manthan2. Manthan2 shows significantly improved runtime performance compared to Manthan. In an extensive experimental evaluation on 609 benchmarks, Manthan2 is able to synthesise a Boolean function vector for 509 instances compared to 356 instances solved by Manthan – an increment of 153 instances over the state-of-the-art. To put this into perspective, Manthan improved on the prior state-of-the-art by only 76 instances.","tags":null,"title":"Engineering an Efficient Boolean Functional Synthesis Engine","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1625811300,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1625811300,"objectID":"6d8576abb9e2c88d2c5a8291f2db7a11","permalink":"/talk/09072021/","publishdate":"2021-07-09T14:15:00+08:00","relpermalink":"/talk/09072021/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"\u003cb\u003eOur paper Designing Samplers is Easy: The Boon of Testers has been accepted to \u003ca href=\"https://fmcad.org/FMCAD21/\"\u003eFMCAD 2021\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/b\u003e \u003cbr\u003e Our Sampler not only passes the tests of Barbarik but also leads to significant performance improvements for real-world instances. \u003cbr\u003e Authors: Priyanka Golia, Mate Soos, Sourav Chakraborty, Kuldeep S.

Uniform sampling is a fundamental problem with a wide variety of applications. The computational intractability of uniform sampling has led to the development of several samplers that heavily rely on heuristics and are not accompanied by theoretical analysis of their distribution. Recently, Chakraborty and Meel (2019) designed the first scalable sampling tester, Barbarik, based on a grey-box sampling technique for testing if the distribution, according to which the given sampler is sampling, is close to the uniform or far from uniform. While the theoretical analysis of Barbarik provides only unconditional soundness guarantees, the empirical evaluation of Barbarik did show its success in determining that some of the off-the-shelf samplers were far from a uniform sampler. The availability of Barbarik has the potential to spur development of samplers and testing techniques such that developers can design sampling methods that can be accepted by Barbarik even though these samplers may not be amenable to a detailed mathematical analysis. In this paper, we present the realization of this aforementioned promise. Based on the flexibility offered by CryptoMiniSat, we design a sampler CMSGen that promises the achievement of sweet spot of the quality of distributions and runtime performance. In particular, CMSGen achieves significant runtime performance improvement over the existing samplers. We conduct two case studies, and demonstrate that the usage of CMSGen leads to significant runtime improvements in the context of combinatorial testing and functional synthesis. A salient strength of our work is the simplicity of CMSGen, which stands in contrast to complicated algorithmic schemes developed in the past that fail to attain desired quality of distributions with practical runtime performance.","tags":null,"title":"Designing Samplers is Easy: The Boon of Testers","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Given a specification φ(X, Y ) over inputs X and output Y , defined over a background theory T, the problem of program synthesis is to design a program f such that Y = f (X) satisfies the specification φ.

In QBF an existentially quantified variable is allowed to depend on all universally quantified variables in its scope. Dependency Quantified Boolean Formulas (DQBF) restricts the dependen- cies of existentially quantified variables. In DQBF, existentially quantified variables have explicit dependencies on subset of universally quantified variables, called Henkin dependencies. Given a Boolean specification between the set of inputs and set of outputs, the problem of Henkin synthesis is to synthesise each output variable as a function of its Henkin dependencies such that the specification is met. Henkin synthesis has wide- ranging applications, including verification of partial circuits, the synthesis of safe controllers, analysis of games. In this work, we propose a machine learning-based approach to Henkin synthesis, called DepManthan. DepManthan is the first general-purpose technique that can synthesise Henkin functions for both True and False DQBF instances. On an extensive evaluation over 550 instances, we demonstrate that DepManthan can synthesise functions for 350 instances compared to 101 instances by the prior state-of-the-art.","tags":null,"title":"Henkin Synthesis: DQBF meets Machine Learning","type":"workshop"},{"authors":["Priyanka Golia","Subhajit Roy","Kuldeep S.

Despite intense algorithmic development, a large number of problems remain beyond the reach of the state of the art techniques. Motivated by the progress in machine learning, we propose Manthan, a novel data-driven approach to Boolean functional synthesis. Manthan views functional synthesis as a classification problem, relying on advances in constrained sampling for data generation, and advances in automated reasoning for a novel proof-guided refinement and provable verification.\nManthan significantly improves upon the current state of the art, solving 356 benchmarks in comparison to 280, which is the most solved by a state of the art technique; thereby, it demonstrate an increase of 76 benchmarks over the current state of the art. Furthermore, Manthan solves 60 benchmarks that none of the current state of the art techniques could solve.\n","date":1585958400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1585958400,"objectID":"6bd489f24a85fe7996c13957eb7d5fde","permalink":"/project/manthan/","publishdate":"2020-04-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/manthan/","section":"project","summary":"Manthan: A Data-Driven Approach for Boolean Function Synthesis","tags":["functional synthesis"],"title":"Manthan","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1581955200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1581955200,"objectID":"ed3290dccf593177b716cf85ee5c306b","permalink":"/talk/18022020/","publishdate":"2020-02-18T00:00:00+08:00","relpermalink":"/talk/18022020/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"\u003cb\u003e Sampling-based approach for quantittive quantitative verification of Deep Neural Nets. \u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe propose a new attack agnostic metric adversarial hardness to capture the model\u0026apos;s robustness: \u003ca href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.06864.pdf\"\u003ehttps://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.06864.pdf\u003c/a\u003e  Authors: Teodora Baluta, Zheng Leong Chua, Kuldeep S.
