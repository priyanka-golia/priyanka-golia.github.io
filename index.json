In QBF, an existentially quantified variable is allowed to depend on all universally quantified variables in its scope. Dependency Quantified Boolean Formulas (DQBF) restrict the dependencies of existentially quantified variables. In DQBF, existentially quantified variables have explicit dependencies on a subset of universally quantified variables, called Henkin dependencies. Given a Boolean specification between the  set of inputs and outputs, the problem of Henkin synthesis is to synthesize each output variable as a function of its Henkin dependencies such that the specification is met. Henkin synthesis has wide-ranging applications, including verification of partial circuits, controller synthesis, and circuit realizability.\nThis work proposes a data-driven approach for Henkin synthesis called HSynth. On an extensive evaluation of over 563 instances arising from past DQBF solving competitions, we demonstrate thatHSynth is competitive with state-of-the-art tools.

Over the past decade, syntax-guided synthesis (SyGuS) has emerged as a dominant approach to program synthesis where in addition to the specification φ, the end-user also specifies a grammar L to aid the underlying synthesis engine. This paper investigates the feasibility of synthesis techniques without grammar, a sub-class defined as T-constrained synthesis. We show that T-constrained synthesis can be reduced DQF(T), i.e., to the problem of finding a witness of a dependency quantified formula modulo theory. When the underlying theory is bitvectors, the corresponding DQF problem can be further reduced to Dependency Quantified Boolean Formulas (DQBF). We rely on the progress in DQBF solving to design DQBF-based synthesizers that outpeform the domain-specific program synthesis techniques, thereby positioning DQBF as a core representation language for program synthesis. Our empirical analysis shows that T-constrained synthesis can achieve significantly better scalability than syntax-guided approaches. Furthermore, the general purpose DQBF solvers perform on par with domain-specific synthesis techniques. DeQuS takes a program synthesis instances and reduce it to a DQF(T) instance.

Although the past few years have witnessed intense algorithmic development, accomplishing scalability remains the holy grail. The state-of-the-art approach combines machine learning and automated reasoningto synthesise Boolean functions efficiently. In this paper, we propose fouralgorithmic improvements for a data-driven framework for functional synthesis: using a dependency-driven multi-classifier to learn candidatefunction, extracting uniquely defined functions by interpolation, variables retention, and using lexicographic MaxSAT to repair candidates. We implement these improvements in the state-of-the-art framework, called Manthan. The proposed framework is called Manthan2. Manthan2 shows significantly improved runtime performance compared to Manthan. In an extensive experimental evaluation on 609 benchmarks, Manthan2 is able to synthesise a Boolean function vector for 509 instances compared to 356 instances solved by Manthan – an increment of 153 instances over the state-of-the-art. To put this into perspective, Manthan improved on the prior state-of-the-art by only 76 instances.","tags":null,"title":"Engineering an Efficient Boolean Functional Synthesis Engine","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1625820300,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1625820300,"objectID":"6d8576abb9e2c88d2c5a8291f2db7a11","permalink":"/talk/09072021/","publishdate":"2021-07-09T14:15:00+05:30","relpermalink":"/talk/09072021/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"\u003cb\u003eOur paper Designing Samplers is Easy: The Boon of Testers has been accepted to \u003ca href=\"https://fmcad.org/FMCAD21/\"\u003eFMCAD 2021\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/b\u003e \u003cbr\u003e Our Sampler not only passes the tests of Barbarik but also leads to significant performance improvements for real-world instances. \u003cbr\u003e Joint work with: Mate Soos, Sourav Chakraborty, Kuldeep S.

Over the past decade, syntax-guided synthesis (SyGuS) has emerged as a dominant approach to program synthesis where in addition to the specification φ, the end-user also specifies a grammar L to aid the underlying synthesis engine. This paper investigates the feasibility of synthesis techniques without grammar, a sub-class defined as T-constrained synthesis. We show that T-constrained synthesis can be reduced DQF(T), i.e., to the problem of finding a witness of a dependency quantified formula modulo theory. When the underlying theory is bitvectors, the corresponding DQF problem can be further reduced to Dependency Quantified Boolean Formulas (DQBF). We rely on the progress in DQBF solving to design DQBF-based synthesizers that outpeform the domain-specific program synthesis techniques, thereby positioning DQBF as a core representation language for program synthesis. Our empirical analysis shows that T-constrained synthesis can achieve significantly better scalability than syntax-guided approaches. Furthermore, the general purpose DQBF solvers perform on par with domain-specific synthesis techniques.","tags":null,"title":"Program Synthesis as Dependency Quantified Formula Modulo Theory","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1595356200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1595356200,"objectID":"5c987d6c035fc412b0aa29497ca160a7","permalink":"/talk/22072020/","publishdate":"2020-07-22T00:00:00+05:30","relpermalink":"/talk/22072020/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"We presented a data-driven approach for [Boolean functional synthesis](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~meel/Papers/cav20-grm.pdf), which works at the intersection of constrained sampling, machine learning and automated reasoning at [CAV 2020](http://i-cav.org/2020/).","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1594802700,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1594802700,"objectID":"950214d6c84a2140c640a1f70bbb9d47","permalink":"/talk/15072020/","publishdate":"2020-07-15T14:15:00+05:30","relpermalink":"/talk/15072020/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"\u003cb\u003ePresented a talk on a data driven approach for Boolean function synthesis at 4th Workshop on Learning in Verification (LiVe), ETPAS, 2020 and at Software Engineering Research in India, SERI, 2020\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/b\u003e","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Priyanka Golia","Subhajit Roy","Kuldeep S.

Despite intense algorithmic development, a large number of problems remain beyond the reach of the state of the art techniques. Motivated by the progress in machine learning, we propose Manthan, a novel data-driven approach to Boolean functional synthesis. Manthan views functional synthesis as a classification problem, relying on advances in constrained sampling for data generation, and advances in automated reasoning for a novel proof-guided refinement and provable verification. On an extensive and rigorous evaluation over 609 benchmarks, we demonstrate that Manthan significantly improves upon the current state of the art, solving 356 benchmarks in comparison to 280, which is the most solved by a state of the art technique; thereby, we demonstrate an increase of 76 benchmarks over the current state of the art. Furthermore, Manthan solves 60 benchmarks that none of the current state of the art techniques could solve. The significant performance improvements, along with our detailed analysis, highlights several interesting avenues of future work at the intersection of machine learning, constrained sampling, and automated reasoning.","tags":null,"title":"Manthan: A Data-Driven Approach for Boolean Function Synthesis","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1594578600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1594578600,"objectID":"2d206bec5baa94771f3aa1333f542d30","permalink":"/talk/04072020/","publishdate":"2020-07-13T00:00:00+05:30","relpermalink":"/talk/04072020/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"\u003cb\u003eWe have released the source code of [Manthan](https://github.com/meelgroup/manthan).\u003c/b\u003e","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1586716200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1586716200,"objectID":"ff227023618add88925ba49c0a121972","permalink":"/talk/07072020/","publishdate":"2020-04-13T00:00:00+05:30","relpermalink":"/talk/07072020/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"\u003cb\u003eOur paper on A data-driven approach for Boolean function synthesis has been accepted to CAV-20\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr\u003e Joint work with: Subhajit Roy and Kuldeep S.
