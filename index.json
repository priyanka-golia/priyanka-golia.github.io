Despite intense algorithmic development, a large number of problems remain beyond the reach of the state of the art techniques. Motivated by the progress in machine learning, we propose Manthan, a novel data-driven approach to Boolean functional synthesis. Manthan views functional synthesis as a classification problem, relying on advances in constrained sampling for data generation, and advances in automated reasoning for a novel proof-guided refinement and provable verification.\nManthan significantly improves upon the current state of the art, solving 356 benchmarks in comparison to 280, which is the most solved by a state of the art technique; thereby, it demonstrate an increase of 76 benchmarks over the current state of the art. Furthermore, Manthan solves 60 benchmarks that none of the current state of the art techniques could solve.\n","date":1585958400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1585958400,"objectID":"6bd489f24a85fe7996c13957eb7d5fde","permalink":"https://priyanka-golia.github.io/project/manthan/","publishdate":"2020-04-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/manthan/","section":"project","summary":"Manthan: A Data-Driven Approach for Boolean Function Synthesis","tags":["functional synthesis"],"title":"Manthan","type":"project"}]
